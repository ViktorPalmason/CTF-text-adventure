  storyText: "Excellent choice! Your team, armed with the knowledge of the opposing
    team's movements, strategically places traps throughout the wooded areas. Pitfalls,
    tripwires, and concealed snares are carefully set, creating a web of obstacles
    for anyone attempting to navigate through.\r\n\r\nAs night falls, your team awaits
    the inevitable clash with the opposing team, confident in the advantage your
    traps provide.\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n\r\n1. Initiate a surprise attack, luring the
    opposing team into the trap-filled woods.\r\n2. Maintain a defensive position
    and let the opposing team come to you. \r\n3. Send a small group to create a
    diversion, drawing the enemy into the trap-laden areas. "

  storyText: ' Your team takes advantage of the distraction caused by the fake skirmish
    to send a stealthy group to infiltrate the opposing team''s base. The stealthy
    group skillfully navigates through the chaos, reaching the enemy base undetected.



    In
    a swift and coordinated maneuver, they retrieve the opposing team''s flag, securing
    victory for your team. The diversionary tactic proves to be a masterstroke, outsmarting
    the opposing team and ensuring a successful conclusion to the game.



    Congratulations
    on a well-executed strategy and the ultimate win!

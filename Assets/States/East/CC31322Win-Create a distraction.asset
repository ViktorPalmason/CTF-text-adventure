  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  storyText: 'your team creates a distraction outside the fortress, diverting attention
    while a smaller group sneaks in. The diversionary tactic successfully confuses
    the opposing team, allowing your infiltrators to search for and retrieve the
    flag undetected.


    As the distraction unfolds outside, your team secures
    the flag and makes a strategic retreat to the wooded areas. The opposing team,
    disoriented and misled, fails to realize the flag has been taken until it''s
    too late.


    Your team celebrates a well-executed plan, and the game is won!
    Congratulations on achieving victory through cunning strategy and teamwork.


    Congratulations
    on achieving victory!


    Push 1 to play again'

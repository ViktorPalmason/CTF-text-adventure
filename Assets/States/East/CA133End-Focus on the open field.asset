  storyText: 'As your team ignores the defensive cover of the ruins and focuses on
    the open field, the opposing team exploits the exposed position. They launch
    a coordinated assault, catching your team off guard and overwhelming your forces.
    The lack of cover and strategic disadvantage result in a swift defeat, and the
    opposing team secures victory by capturing your flag.


    It''s a tough lesson
    learned about the importance of utilizing available advantages on the battlefield.

  storyText: 'The diversionary tactic proves to be a masterstroke. Your team skillfully
    executes a series of maneuvers, creating a convincing illusion that the main
    assault is coming from a different direction. The opposing team takes the bait
    and redirects their attention away from the fortress.


    As the opposing team
    scrambles to defend against the perceived threat, your team seizes the opportunity
    to breach the fortress and retrieve the flag. The diversionary tactic successfully
    misleads the enemy, allowing your team to secure victory in a brilliant and strategic
    maneuver.


    Cheers erupt among your teammates as the realization of success
    sinks in. The game is won, and your team stands triumphant on the battlefield.


    Congratulations
    on achieving victory!

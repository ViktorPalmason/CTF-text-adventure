  storyText: 'Your team initiates a diversionary tactic by staging a fake skirmish
    in one area to draw the attention away from the real flag. The plan unfolds smoothly,
    with your team creating the illusion of a significant engagement in a carefully
    chosen location.

    1. While the opposing team is distracted,
    send a stealthy group to infiltrate their base.

    2. Use the opportunity to
    gather intel on the opposing team''s defensive positions.

    3. Maintain the
    diversion and prepare for a surprise attack on the distracted opposing team.'

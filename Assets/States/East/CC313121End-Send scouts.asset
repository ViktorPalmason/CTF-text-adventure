  storyText: 'The scouts move stealthily through the woods, attempting to gather
    crucial information. Unfortunately, their presence is detected by the opposing
    team''s keen-eyed sentinels. In a swift and coordinated counteraction, the opposing
    team captures the scouts, extracting vital information about your team''s strategy.


    The
    fortress, now aware of your team''s plans, reinforces its defenses, making any
    attempt to breach it futile. The opposing team seizes the opportunity to launch
    a decisive counterattack, catching your team off guard and leading to a swift
    and resounding defeat.

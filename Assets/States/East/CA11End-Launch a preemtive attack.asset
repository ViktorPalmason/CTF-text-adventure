  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  storyText: 'Eager to gain an early advantage, your team launches a preemptive long-range
    attack on the opposing team. However, the attack, though bold, lacks coordination
    and strategy. The opposing team quickly adapts to the situation, using cover
    and terrain to their advantage.

    

    As your team exhausts resources
    and exposes themselves, the opposing team retaliates with a well-coordinated
    counterattack. Caught in the open field without a solid defensive strategy, your
    team faces overwhelming force, leading to defeat and the loss of the game.

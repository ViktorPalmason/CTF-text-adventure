  storyText: 'Your team, fueled by determination, decides to launch a frontal assault
    on the fortress, focusing on breaking through the main entrance. As your team
    advances, the imposing structure looms ahead, its ancient stones echoing with
    the challenge of the impending clash.

    

    The opposing team, aware of
    the threat, readies their defenses within the fortress walls. Archers take their
    positions on the ramparts, and guards stand vigilant at the entrance. The clash
    is inevitable, and your team prepares for the intense showdown.

    

    Options:

    

    1.
    Engage in a direct confrontation, using sheer force to breach the fortress and
    capture the flag.

    2. Utilize ranged attacks and siege weapons to weaken
    the fortress defenses before the frontal assault.

    3. Send a small, elite
    group to infiltrate the fortress from a different angle while the main force
    attacks.'

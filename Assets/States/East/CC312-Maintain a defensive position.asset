  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  storyText: 'Maintaining a defensive position, your team allows the opposing team
    to enter the trap-filled woods. As the enemy navigates the treacherous terrain,
    your group uses the confusion to their advantage. In the chaos, you spot an opportunity
    to capture the flag while the opposing team is disoriented.


    Options:


    1.
    Press the advantage and push deeper into enemy territory.

    2. Send a small
    group to retrieve the flag while the enemy is disoriented.

    3. Use the opportunity
    to negotiate a truce with the opposing team.'

  storyText: 'Your scouts carefully observe the opposing team''s response to the
    decoy flag, but in doing so, they inadvertently reveal the true location of your
    flag. The opposing team, quick to capitalize on this unintentional information,
    launches a decisive assault on your defensive position.


    Caught off guard,
    your team faces a relentless attack, and despite valiant efforts to defend, the
    opposing team manages to capture your flag and secure victory.


    It''s a
    bitter defeat, highlighting the delicate balance between gathering information
    and maintaining secrecy in the game of strategy.

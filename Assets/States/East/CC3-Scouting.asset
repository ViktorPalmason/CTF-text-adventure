  storyText: 'Smart move! Your team sends scouts into the nearby wooded areas, and
    those with an affinity for the earth element use their skills to blend with nature.
    They move silently, avoiding detection as they gather valuable intel.


    The
    scouts report back with information about the opposing team''s movements and
    potential ambush points.


    Options:


    1. Use the gathered intel to set
    up traps in the wooded areas.

    2. Plan a coordinated strike based on the
    enemy''s location.

    3. Return to the open field and use the information to
    strategically position your team.'

  storyText: 'As your team focuses on consolidating the defensive position, the opposing
    team, having identified the decoy flag, launches a decisive and coordinated attack
    on your true defensive position. The defensive measures, while well-intentioned,
    are not enough to withstand the onslaught.


    The opposing team breaches your
    defenses, captures the flag, and secures victory. It''s a bitter realization
    for your team that the diversion, while successful in confusing the enemy, did
    not translate into an effective defensive strategy.

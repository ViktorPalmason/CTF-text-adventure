  storyText: 'As your team attempts to gather intel on the opposing team''s defensive
    positions, a keen-eyed sentry from the opposing team detects the stealthy movement.

    group, extracting vital information about your team''s strategy.


    Armed
    with this newfound knowledge, the opposing team reinforces its defenses, making
    any attempt to breach their base futile. The opposing team seizes the opportunity
    to launch a decisive counterattack, catching your team off guard and leading
    to a swift and resounding defeat.

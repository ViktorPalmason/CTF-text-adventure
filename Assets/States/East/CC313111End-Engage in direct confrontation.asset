  storyText: 'As your team charges headlong towards the main entrance, the opposing
    team''s defenders prove to be a formidable obstacle. The fortress, designed with
    strategic advantages, allows the defenders to repel your frontal assault with
    well-coordinated resistance.


    Caught in a barrage of arrows and spells,
    your team faces significant casualties. The opposing team, leveraging the fortress''s
    defensive features, turns the tide against your exhausted and weakened forces.
    In the end, your team is unable to breach the fortress, leading to defeat and
    the loss of the game.

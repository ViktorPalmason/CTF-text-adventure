  storyText: 'An intriguing choice! Your team, seizing the opportunity, sends a small,
    swift group to infiltrate the abandoned fortress the other team uses as its stronghold
    and retrieve the flag while the opposing team is disoriented in the trap-laden
    woods.


    As they approach the fortress, the team realizes the challenge ahead
    due to the unfamiliar terrain. The flag is hidden within, presenting a difficult
    task.


    Options:


    1. Quietly infiltrate the fortress and search for
    the flag.

    2. Create a distraction outside the fortress to divert attention
    while a smaller group sneaks in.

    3. Abandon the mission and regroup with
    the main team in the woods'

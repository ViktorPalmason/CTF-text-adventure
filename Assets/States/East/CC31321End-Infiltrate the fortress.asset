  storyText: 'As your team stealthily enters the fortress, they encounter unexpected
    challenges within the unfamiliar terrain. The flag''s location proves elusive,
    and the opposing team, detecting the intrusion, quickly mobilizes their defenses.


    Caught
    in a labyrinth of passages and chambers, your team struggles to navigate the
    fortress effectively. The opposing team seizes the opportunity to launch a counterattack,
    trapping your team within the stronghold.


    In the chaos that ensues, your
    team is unable to locate the flag, and the opposing team secures victory. The
    fortress, once a potential advantage, becomes a maze of defeat.

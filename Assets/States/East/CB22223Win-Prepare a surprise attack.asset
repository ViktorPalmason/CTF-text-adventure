  storyText: 'With the opposing team fully engaged in the fake skirmish, your team
    capitalizes on the distraction to reposition and launch a surprise attack. Swiftly
    and decisively, you breach the opposing team''s defenses, retrieve the flag,
    and secure victory.


    As the opposing team realizes the ruse, it''s too late
    to mount a sufficient defense. Cheers erupt among your teammates as you stand
    triumphant on the battlefield, having outsmarted the opposition with a well-executed
    diversion and surprise attack.

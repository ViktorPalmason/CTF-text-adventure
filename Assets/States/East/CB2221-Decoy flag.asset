  storyText: 'Your team swiftly and skillfully stages a convincing setup, placing
    a decoy flag in a strategic but misleading position. The opposing team, observing
    from a distance, falls for the ruse, believing they have identified the true
    location of your flag.


    As the opposing team diverts their focus to the
    decoy flag, your team seizes the opportunity to reinforce the actual defensive
    position. The diversion proves successful, and the opposing team is left scrambling
    to decipher the real location of your flag.


    Options:


    1. Use the diversion
    to launch a surprise attack on the opposing team.

    2. Consolidate your defensive
    position, anticipating the opposing team''s next move.

    3. Send scouts to
    monitor the opposing team''s reaction and gather further intel.'

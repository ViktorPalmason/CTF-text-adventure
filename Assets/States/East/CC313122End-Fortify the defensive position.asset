  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  storyText: 'Your team works diligently to fortify the defensive position, setting
    up barricades and traps to secure the gains. However, in the midst of the fortification
    process, a clever spy from the opposing team infiltrates your camp. The spy gathers
    crucial information about the location of your flag and the defensive measures
    you''ve implemented.


    Armed with this newfound knowledge, the opposing team
    launches a surprise attack, exploiting the weak points in your defenses. Caught
    off guard, your team faces a swift and overwhelming assault, leading to defeat
    and the loss of the game.

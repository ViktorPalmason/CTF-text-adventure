  storyText: 'As your team executes the flanking maneuver, the opposing team proves
    more resilient and adaptive than anticipated. The small group that was sent to
    flank is ambushed by a well-prepared enemy, resulting in significant casualties.


    The
    main force, engaged in long-range attacks, finds itself outmaneuvered and exposed.
    The opposing team, capitalizing on the disarray, launches a coordinated counterattack,
    overwhelming your team.


    The game ends in defeat as the opposing team captures
    your flag and secures victory.

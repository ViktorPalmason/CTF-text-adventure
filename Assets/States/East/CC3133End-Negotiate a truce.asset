  storyText: 'In an attempt to capitalize on the momentary truce, your team cautiously
    approaches the opposing team, suggesting a temporary ceasefire to assess the
    situation. Both sides agree to the truce, and there''s a brief exchange of strategic
    information.


    As your team starts to lower their guard, believing in the
    sincerity of the truce, the opposing team seizes the opportunity to launch a
    surprise attack. Betrayed and caught off guard, your team finds themselves overwhelmed.


    The
    opposing team, having used the truce as a ruse, strategically maneuvers to capture
    your team''s flag and secures victory. The betrayal leaves your team in disbelief
    and disappointment as they reflect on the importance of caution and skepticism
    in the heat of battle.

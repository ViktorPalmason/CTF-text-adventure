  storyText: 'The elite group moves with precision, finding a hidden entrance and
    infiltrating the fortress undetected. As the main force engages the defenders
    in a frontal assault, the elite team maneuvers through secret passages, avoiding
    the brunt of the opposition.



    With skillful stealth and timing, the elite
    team reaches the inner chambers, retrieves the opposing team''s flag, and signals
    the victory. The defenders inside the fortress are caught off guard, and your
    team celebrates a strategic triumph.



    Congratulations on achieving victory
    in the game!

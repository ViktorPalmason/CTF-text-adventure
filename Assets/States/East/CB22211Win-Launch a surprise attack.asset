  storyText: 'Capitalizing on the confusion caused by the decoy flag, your team executes
    a swift and coordinated surprise attack on the opposing team. Caught off guard
    and disoriented, the enemy struggles to regroup as your team infiltrates their
    defensive lines.


    The surprise attack proves highly effective, disrupting
    the opposing team''s coordination and creating chaos among their ranks. Your
    team manages to breach the fortress, retrieve the flag, and secure victory.


    As
    the opposing team realizes the deception, it''s too late to mount a counterattack.
    Your team celebrates a well-executed strategy that outmaneuvered the enemy.


    Congratulations
    on achieving victory! If you have any more decisions to make or if you''d like
    to explore a different branch, feel free to let me know!

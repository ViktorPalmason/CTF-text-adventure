  storyText: 'As your team initiates the surprise attack, the opposing team, though
    caught off guard, quickly rallies their defenses. The trap-filled woods become
    a chaotic battleground, and despite your initial advantage, the opposing team
    proves resilient.


    In the midst of the skirmish, your team falls into a
    cleverly laid trap by the opposing team. A net drops from the trees, ensnaring
    your group and leaving them vulnerable. The opposing team seizes the opportunity,
    captures your flag, and secures victory.


    The defeat is palpable, and as
    the opposing team celebrates, your team reflects on the strategic errors that
    led to this unfortunate outcome. The game is lost, but valuable lessons are learned
    for future challenges

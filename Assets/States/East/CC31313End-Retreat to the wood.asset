  storyText: 'As your team retreats to the safety of the wooded areas, the opposing
    team, quick to capitalize on your momentary vulnerability, swiftly regroups and
    launches a coordinated counterattack. The sudden onslaught catches your team
    off guard, and despite valiant efforts to defend, the opposing team overwhelms
    your position.


    In the chaos of the ambush, your team''s flag is captured,
    securing victory for the opposing team. The woods, once a place of tactical advantage,
    become a trap, leading to the bitter realization that strategic retreats require
    careful planning.


    The defeat is profound, and as the opposing team celebrates,
    your team reflects on the consequences of choosing caution over a decisive strategy.
    If you''d like to continue the adventure or explore a different branch, feel

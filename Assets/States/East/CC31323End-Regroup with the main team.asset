  storyText: 'As your team regroups in the woods, the opposing team, having recovered
    from the initial confusion, swiftly discerns your team''s intentions. With the
    flag still secure in their fortress, the opposing team takes advantage of your
    team''s indecision and launches a counterattack.


    Caught off guard and without
    a clear strategy, your team faces a decisive assault. The opposing team captures
    your flag and secures victory, leaving your team in disappointment as they reflect
    on the missed opportunity.


    Push 1 to play again.'

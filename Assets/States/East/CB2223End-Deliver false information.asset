  storyText: 'The small group, tasked with delivering false information, underestimates
    the cunning of the opposing team. The deceptive plan backfires as the information
    is intercepted and used against your team. Seizing the opportunity, the opposing
    team swiftly infiltrates your defensive position, retrieves the flag, and secures
    victory.


    It''s a bitter defeat for your team, and as the opposing team
    celebrates, your team reflects on the importance of executing deceptive strategies
    with caution.

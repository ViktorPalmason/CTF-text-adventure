  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  storyText: 'As your team begins the barrage of ranged attacks and siege weapon
    assaults, the opposing team quickly adapts to the strategy. They fortify their
    defenses, utilizing shields and magical barriers to withstand the onslaught.
    The time taken to weaken the fortress allows the opposing team to counteract
    and reinforce their positions.



    In a sudden turn of events, the opposing
    team launches a counterattack, taking advantage of the weakened state of your
    forces. The fortress, now more resilient than before, becomes an impenetrable
    barrier. Your team faces a relentless assault, resulting in defeat and the loss
    of the game.

  storyText: "A cunning move! Your team selects a small, agile group to create a
    diversion. They skillfully attract the attention of the opposing team, leading
    them deeper into the trap-laden woods.\r\n\r\nAs the enemy falls into the strategically
    placed traps, chaos ensues. Your main team takes advantage of the distraction
    to position themselves for a decisive strike.\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n\r\n1. Capitalize
    on the confusion and launch a full-scale assault.\r\n2. Send a group to retrieve
    the flag while the enemy is disoriented. \r\n3. Use the opportunity to negotiate
    a truce with the opposing team. "

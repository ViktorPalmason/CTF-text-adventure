  storyText: 'Great! Your team equips themselves with the discovered weapons, ranging
    from swords to makeshift shields. The feeling of empowerment courses through
    your ranks as you exit the armory.

    

    As your team leaves the fortress,
    you hear distant footsteps and catch a glimpse of the opposing team advancing
    towards the fortress.

    

    Options:

    

    1. Prepare for a defensive
    stance within the fortress.

    2. Send a decoy group to mislead the opposing
    team while the majority of your team flanks them.

    3. Retreat quietly and
    regroup with your team on the western side of the field.'

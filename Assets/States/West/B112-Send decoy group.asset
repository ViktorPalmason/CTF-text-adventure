  storyText: "A clever strategy! Your team splits into two groups\u2014a decoy group
    that confidently marches towards the opposing team, drawing their attention,
    and a flanking group that silently moves through the woods to catch the enemy
    off guard.\r\n\r\nAs the decoy group engages the opponents, the flanking team
    executes a successful ambush. Chaos ensues among the opposing team, giving your
    team the upper hand.\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n\r\n1. Press the advantage and push deeper
    into enemy territory.\r\n2. Capture the flag while the opposing team is disoriented.\r\n3.
    Fall back to the fortress for a more defensive position."

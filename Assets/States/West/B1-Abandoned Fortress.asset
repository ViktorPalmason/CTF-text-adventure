  storyText: 'Bold choice! Your team cautiously approaches the fortress, the creaking
    sound of the rusty gate echoing through the air as you enter. Inside, you find
    remnants of an old armory with dusty weapons and worn-out armor.

    

    Options:

    

    1.
    Arm your team with the found weapons for a strategic advantage.

    2. Search
    for hidden passages or defensive positions within the fortress.

    3. Leave
    the fortress and head back to your side of the field before the opposing team
    notices your absence'
